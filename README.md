# Overview

This is a fairly simple application to help track the progress of ones goals. At the moment there is only very basic functionality: one can add or remove their goals and set a percentage for how much they feel they have mastered a goal. 

In the future I plan to add:
* the ability to add subgoals, based on which the cumulative percentage would be calculated
* ability to have different colors for different goals
* ability to reorder the tasks, preferably with drag and drop functionality
* additional user options for ease of use
* a separate tab for completed tasks (hall of fame)
* possibly some way to track statistics and draw graphs, so that one could check their progress over time

# Requirements

Python 3
Kivy 1.10.1 (that's the version I used, though other versions may work as well)
