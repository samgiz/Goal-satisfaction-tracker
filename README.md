# Overview

This is a fairly simple application to help track the progress of ones goals. The following functionalities are currently supported:
* Adding goals and setting their percentages
* Reordering the goals using drag  and drop functionality

In the future I plan to add:
* the ability to add subgoals, based on which the cumulative percentage would be calculated
* ability to have different colors for different goals
* additional user options for ease of use
* a separate tab for completed goals (hall of fame)
* possibly some way to track statistics and draw graphs, so that one could check their progress over time

# Requirements

* Python 3
* Kivy 1.10.1 (that's the version I used, though other versions may work as well)
